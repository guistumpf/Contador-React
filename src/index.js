import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import App from './App';
import './index.css';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(
<App/> 
);


// It is necessary to add the CSS. I also need to understand useState and setNumero (setStateAction). The code seems organized and I will probably use it as a reference for the presentation.
